## DALL-E and ChatGPT Assistant App

This is a Flutter application that utilizes the DALL-E and ChatGPT APIs to allow users to provide voice instructions and receive text-based responses from the app.

The app uses the device's microphone to capture the user's voice input, which is then processed by the DALL-E and ChatGPT APIs to generate a response. If the response is not an image, the app will read out the response to the user.
